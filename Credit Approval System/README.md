# Credit Approval System

Backend system for credit approval and loan management built with Django 4+ and Django Rest Framework

## ðŸš€ Single Command Setup

```bash
# Start all services (DB, Web, Redis, Celery)
docker-compose up --build

# In a new terminal, after services are up (wait 1-2 minutes)
docker-compose exec web python manage.py ingest_data
```

That's it! The system is ready at http://localhost:8000

To stop: `docker-compose down`
To restart: `docker-compose up`

## System Requirements

cd credit-approval-system
```

2. Create .env file in project root
```
POSTGRES_DB=credit_approval_db
POSTGRES_USER=postgres

## Business Rules

1. Credit Score Calculation (0-100)
   - Past loans paid on time
   - Number of loans taken
   - Loan activity in current year
   - Loan approved volume
   - Current loans vs approved limit

2. Loan Approval Rules
   - If credit_rating > 50 approve any loan
   - If 30 < credit_rating <= 50 approve loans with interest rate > 12%
   - If 10 < credit_rating <= 30 approve loans with interest rate > 16%
   - If credit_rating <= 10 no loans approved
   - If sum of all current EMIs > 50% of monthly salary no loans approved

3. Interest Rate Correction
   - If approved interest rate does not match credit rating slab corrected rate is sent in response
   - Example If credit_rating = 20 and interest_rate = 8% corrected_interest_rate will be 16%

## Testing

1. Using PowerShell Script
```powershell
# Run comprehensive API tests
.\test_terminal.ps1
```

2. Using Python Script
```bash
# Run detailed tests with validation
python test_all_features.py
```

3. Manual Testing with curl
```bash
# Register new customer
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/register/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"first_name\":\"Test\", \"last_name\":\"User\", \"age\":30, \"monthly_income\":50000, \"phone_number\":\"9876543001\"}"

# Check eligibility
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/check-eligibility/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"customer_id\":310, \"loan_amount\":100000, \"interest_rate\":16, \"tenure\":12}"

# Create loan
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/create-loan/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"customer_id\":310, \"loan_amount\":100000, \"interest_rate\":16, \"tenure\":12}"

# View loan
curl http://localhost:8000/api/view-loan/5930

# View customer loans
curl http://localhost:8000/api/view-loans/1
```

## Error Handling

## Troubleshooting

1. Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL logs
docker-compose logs db

# Reset database
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up --build
```

2. Data Ingestion Issues
```bash
# Check Excel files exist
ls customer_data.xlsx loan_data.xlsx

# Retry data ingestion
docker-compose exec web python manage.py ingest_data
```

3. API Connection Issues
```bash
# Check web server logs
docker-compose logs web

# Restart web server
docker-compose restart web
```

## Development

1. Making Code Changes
```bash
# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Apply migrations
docker-compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate

# Run tests
docker-compose exec web python manage.py test
```

2. Accessing Database
```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d credit_approval_db

# View tables
\dt

# Query data
SELECT * FROM credit_app_customer LIMIT 5;
